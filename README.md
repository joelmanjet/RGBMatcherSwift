## RGB Matcher

This is a simple color matching game made with Swift UiKit where the user is given a color to match on the right and must match it to the best of their abilities on the left within 10 seconds, the user has 3 sliders which intensifies each type of color, once the 10 seconds are up a pop up appears where a score is calculated based off of their accuracy. This project taught me how to use a UISlider, a UIAlertController/UIAlertAction, and overall gained more experinece with the language.
